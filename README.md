About ME
I am Rahul Vemula, and I am thrilled to be on the cusp of completing my Master of Science in Business Analytics and Information Systems from the University of South Florida.Prior to my pursuit of higher education, I honed my management abilities as an Assistant Operations Manager at Optival Health Solution Pvt Ltd in Hyderabad, India.
